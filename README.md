# File Management System 🗄️✨

In this partner project at Holberton School, we will be utilizing the back-end tools we have learned this trimester. We will be touching on authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. Our objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files, or, a file manager.

The file manager should perform the following operations:
- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

## Learning Objectives: 📖✨

- Create an API with Express
- Authenticate a user
- Store data in MongoDB
- Store temporary data in Redis
- Setup and use a background worker
